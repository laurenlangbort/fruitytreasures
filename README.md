Fruity Treasures 
Welcome to Fruity Treasures, a vibrant e-commerce platform dedicated to promoting cultural diversity and healthy eating. We make it easy for people to access affordable fruits from underrepresented cultures that are often hard to find in traditional supermarkets.

Our Mission
At Fruity Treasures, our mission is to:

Promote cultural diversity by offering a variety of fruits from different parts of the world.
Encourage healthy eating habits with fresh, nutritious, and unique fruits.
Make these fruits accessible to everyone through our online platform.
We are a diverse team who loves food and is passionate about representing our cultures! Our website is more than just a marketplaceâ€”it's a way to celebrate the richness of global flavors.

Project Goals
This project started as a way for us to use new technologies learned throughout the spring semester to improve the usability, appearance, and functionality of the original Fruity Treasures site. Some of the features we've implemented include:

Frontend Enhancements: The first draft of our website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on improving the user experience and visual appeal of our e-commerce platform.

Lost Backend Features: Unfortunately, due to an issue with our hosting provider (SiteGround), we lost the functionality tied to our PHP and SQL backend. These features included:

The ability to add items to the cart.
A database for storing the contents of the shopping cart.
PHP logic for calculating total costs, taxes, and item removal from the cart.
A system for saving purchased items in a separate database.

Technology Stack
Our current website uses the following technologies:

HTML5 & CSS3 for structure and styling.
JavaScript for interactivity and client-side functionality.
PHP & MySQL (to be re-implemented) for handling cart logic, database management, and order processing.

Future Improvements
In the next phase of development, we plan to:

Reintroduce the PHP and SQL backend for a fully functional shopping cart.
Implement advanced features such as user accounts, saved shopping lists, and order history.
Explore modern JavaScript frameworks to enhance the user interface and improve overall performance.
